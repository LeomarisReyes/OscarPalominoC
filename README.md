# Hello there (General Kenobi) üëã

I'm an Industrial Engineer, specialized in Data Science at Platzi Master. As a Data Scientist in formation at Platzi Master, I provide truthful and accurate information, so that decision-making is facilitated. 

As part of my Platzi Master training, I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, Javascript, C# and preprocessors like Pug and SASS.

‚ö° The technologies I have learned in Platzi are:
* Python üêç
* HTML and CSS
* Javascript
* R
* C#
* Spark
* Hadoop
* XPath
* Relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL
* Non relational databases like MongoDB

The libraries that I have learned as a DS are:
* Numpy üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* Pandas üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* Requests 
* BeautifulSoup
* lxml
* Selenium

## Projects üõ†

### News Inc üìú

My recent project that I have worked with other talentful programmers is [News Inc](https://news-inc.web.app/).

I was the Data Miner of the News Inc project, in this project, the articles were extracted from 6 newspapers that allow web scraping, these newspapers are from di erent countries. Once the information is extracted it is stored in a non-relational database in Mongo DB.

The technologies used for the Data Extraction in this project were Python, Pandas, Requests, XPath, MongoDB, PyYaml, lxml, os library, and Subprocess library.

[Here is the repo for the entire project!](https://github.com/Team-C5-News-Inc)

### Handwritten Recognition ü§ñ

Handwritten Recognition is a collaboration at Platzi Master, it was made by a powerful team of talentful programmers.

There were two DS at this project [Juan](https://github.com/juanpanu) and me. We were in charge to build the Convolutional Neural Network to analyze two signatures, one stored in a database online, and the other provided by the user, if these two signatures were alike at least 90%, you would get a confirmation that, that is your signature, if not, you would get a message telling you that the signatures were not alike.

Unfortunately there is no live demo online, but [here you can see the repo for the project!](https://github.com/SWAT-Handwritten-Recognition/).

### Titanic ‚õ¥

This project was about calculating the possible ammount of dead people if USS Carpathia and no other ships would have arrived to the place where the Titaninc sunk.

### Titanic - Transforming a Data Set with Pandas

This was a challenge from Platzi Master, it was fun using Pandas library and the functions to collect the data and get results. In the begining of the colab notebook are the questions to solve with Pandas.

### Twitter Scrapper üê¶

This is another challenge from Platzi Master, in it, you can select the search patterns you want to get. In this case, I used the Tweepy library to collect the data from Twitter.
